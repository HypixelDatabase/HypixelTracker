You can left-click to claim 1 of these 3 rewards to receive in-game. Hover over a revealed card to find out more about it.\n\nReward Cards can be Common, Rare, Epic or Legendary rarity level. Common is the least valuable, and Legendary is the most valuable and most difficult to find.\n\nBy default you can claim 1 time per day - the timer resets each day at midnight EST (04:00AM UTC).\n\n<h1>REWARD TOKENS</h1>\n\nYou can use Reward Tokens to claim more rewards - 1 token can be spent at the Delivery Man to let you claim 1 extra time. Reward Tokens can currently be found in cards, and we may add more ways to unlock them across the server.\n\n<h1>DAILY STREAK</h1>\n\nIncluded in the system is a Daily Streak counter. For each day you claim in a row, you build up your streak which is displayed on the Rewards web page. After claiming each day for 9 days in a row, you get 1 free Reward Token, which lets you claim 1 extra time!\n\n<h1>SHARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA</h1>\n\nAfter claiming a card you can share it on Twitter or Facebook by clicking the icons. You can also download the card image for uploading on other websites, or sharing right here on the forums!",
